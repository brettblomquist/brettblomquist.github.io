        <p>This is my website that I have built from the ground up to present myself in a web format. I will use
           this webpage to present the content of my résumé in a clear and concise manner while simultaneously
           showing my knowledge of various programming languages by building this website. Those various
           programming languages include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These are the different languages used to develop
           this webpage.
