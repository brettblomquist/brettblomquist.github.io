        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Brett Blomquist, and I am a Computer Information Systems Major at Valley City State
            University. I am from Fargo, North Dakota, and I went to Fargo North High School. My family conisists
            of both my parents, as well as two brothers and a dog. While in high
            school, I took multiple AP classes as well as latin for 3 years. I believe that taking those 
            courses has helped me develop useful skills for the future.

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
            Some of my hobbies include playing video games, watching movies, and spending time with friends. I 
            also love reading-specifically books about philosophy. I have read numerous original works from ancient
            philosophers and enjoy learning and reasearching about philsophy in my free time. Some of my favorite
            philosophers are Rene Descartes and Marcus Aurelius.
