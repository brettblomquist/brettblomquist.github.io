    <p id="p1">Batarangs: These are customizable throwing weapons, similar to shurikens, and are collapsible so that a large number of them can fit inside of Batman's utility belt. There are several special varieties of the batarang, aside from the regular type. Explosive batarangs explode once they hit their target. Electric batarangs deliver powerful electric shocks to whatever they come in contact with. These batarangs can incapacitate enemies or overload electronic devices. Remote-controlled batarangs let Batman fully steer the batarang via a remote control. These are used when a straight line of sight isn't possible. These batarangs have cameras in them so that Batman can see where they are going.</p>
    <p id="p2">Batline/Batrope/Batclaw/Batgrapple: A handheld grappling hook that shoots out a claw-shaped projectile on a retractable high-tensile cord, which grabs onto a surface. Then, this cord pulls Batman to his target. A later boost upgrade launches him high into the air above the target point if he desires (so Batman can glide from there). The hook can also pull down walls, grab enemies and pull them closer, or pull guns straight out of their hands. The hook is secured to the belt magnetically rather than being contained in the belt. It has been portrayed as a portable grappling hook line to be manually thrown onto a higher surface or vantage point for him to climb it to the targeted area.</p>
